# Embers' Construct
 All the [tinkers'](https://github.com/SlimeKnights/TinkersConstruct/) stuff in [Embers](https://github.com/DaedalusGame/EmbersRekindled). Literally. 
 No, really, "every" casting recipe is now added to the stamper (with a lot of stamps).
 All mixing recipes (alloys) from tinker are added to Embers via the centrifuge (if possible).
 Also you can now melt a LOT of things in the melter.

 Inspired by [this](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tinkering-with-embers) lovely mod (and this is also the resource for the textures).
 
## Stamps
 Currently there are 30 stamps for the different toolparts added.
 You can craft a stamp with a raw caminite plate and the toolpart you want the stamp for (sadly the toolpart gets consumed).
 The you can burn the result to a proper stamp.
