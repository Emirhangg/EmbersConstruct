# Embers' Construct
All the [tinkers'](https://github.com/SlimeKnights/TinkersConstruct/) stuff in [Embers](https://github.com/DaedalusGame/EmbersRekindled). Literally. 
No, really, "every" casting recipe is now added to the stamper (with a lot of stamps).
All mixing recipes (alloys) from tinker are added to Embers via the centrifuge (if possible).
Also you can now melt a LOT of things in the melter.

Inspired by [this](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tinkering-with-embers) lovely mod (and this is also the resource for the textures).

## Stamps
Currently there are all stamps for the default toolparts added.
You can craft them by putting Raw Flat Stamps in the Stamp Table and selecting a pattern, then baking them in the Kiln

 

## Mod Compatibility
Currently this mod also supports:
- Constructs Armory
- Tinkers Compendium
 

## Additional Information
- Due to my lack in finding bugs and actively playtesting this mod (seems weird right?), I ask you teport bugs here
- Due to changes on how this mod works the versions older than 1.2.0, stamps are not 100% kept between version changes. But you should be able to reuse the already crafted stamps (as long as they are the default TC ones) in the Stamp Table.
- You may use this mod in a modpack
- This mod does not rely on CraftTweaker scripts or something like that!
